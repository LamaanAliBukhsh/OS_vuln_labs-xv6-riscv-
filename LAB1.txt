LAB 1: BUFFER OVERFLOW
======================

Goal: Find the flag by exploiting a missing bounds check

System Call: getprocinfo(size, buffer)
Location: kernel/sysproc.c

Test: procinfo (safe)
Execute:
  procinfo


Hint: The syscall accepts a size parameter but doesn't validate it.
What happens if you request more bytes than intended?

Solution: exp1.c
