LAB 2: PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
============================

Goal: Gain root access and read the password file

System Calls: setroot(uid, magic), readpassword(buf)
Location: kernel/sysproc.c

Test: password (fails without root)
Execute:
  password

Hint: The authentication logic has a bug with boolean operators.
Look carefully at the condition in setroot(). Should it use || or &&?

Solution: exp2.c
