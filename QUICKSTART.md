# Quick Start Guide - xv6 Vulnerability Labs

## For Medium Article Readers 👋

Welcome! This guide will get you up and running in **less than 5 minutes**.

## The Absolute Easiest Way 🚀

### Step 1: Click This Button

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/LamaanAliBukhsh/OS_vuln_labs-xv6-riscv-)

### Step 2: Wait for Setup
- A cloud-based development environment will start
- This takes about 2-3 minutes
- Everything installs automatically (RISC-V toolchain, QEMU, etc.)

### Step 3: Run xv6
Once the setup is complete, type this in the terminal:
```bash
make qemu
```

### Step 4: Start Hacking!
You're now running xv6! You can:
- Explore the vulnerable programs
- Test exploits from the article
- Learn by doing

**To exit xv6:** Press `Ctrl-A` then `X`

## What Just Happened?

GitHub Codespaces created a **complete development environment** in the cloud with:
- ✅ No local installation needed
- ✅ Works on any OS (Windows, Mac, Linux, even iPad!)
- ✅ All tools pre-installed
- ✅ Runs in your browser
- ✅ **Free tier: 60 hours/month**

## Next Steps

1. **Follow the Medium article** to understand each vulnerability
2. **Try the exploits** in the safe xv6 environment
3. **Experiment** - you can't break anything!
